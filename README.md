## Docker Image for OpenFOAM and Calculix in a Desktop Environment

This Docker image is for experimenting OpenFOAM and Calculix for
fluid-structure interaction.

### About [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/)

OpenFOAM (for "Open source Field Operation And Manipulation") is a C++
toolbox for the development of customized numerical solvers, and
pre-/post-processing utilities for the solution of continuum mechanics
problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The code is
released as free and open source software under the GNU General Public
License. The OpenFOAM name was registered by OpenCFD Ltd in 2007
and non-exclusively licensed to the OpenFOAM Foundation Ltd in 2011.

### About [CalculiX](http://www.calculix.de/)

CalculiX is a free, open-source software for solving three-dimensional
structural mechanics using the finite element method.  With CalculiX
Finite Element Models can be build, calculated and post-processed. The
pre- and post-processor is an interactive 3D-tool using OpenGL. The
solver is able to do linear and non-linear calculations. Static,
dynamic and thermal solutions are available. The solver makes use of
the abaqus input format, and its pre-processor can write mesh related
data for nastran, abaqus, ansys, code-aster and for the free-cfd codes
dolfyn, duns, ISAAC and OpenFOAM. A simple STEP reader is included. In
addition external CAD interfaces like vda_to_fbd are available. 

A number of example FEA models for CalculiX can be found at 
[mkraska/CalculiX-Examples](https://github.com/mkraska/CalculiX-Examples/).
